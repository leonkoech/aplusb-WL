### Run script with python on windows ( js version)
- Create a folder called `outputCases` in your project root directory
- Basically run `python main.py`
- For a particular file run `type .\testcases\[name of input].txt | node javascript.js` 

*Note: remember to replace `[name of input]` with an input file, eg: `input000`, also this is just a workaround if `WSL` is giving you problems, still needs more work in term of providing output on errors. For now it will only provide the file differences with the line numbers*
